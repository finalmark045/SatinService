LOLService
==========
Note*: LOLService recently updated to version 2.0, so a lot of the older code just doesn't work anymore.
The metaploit module is the only code I'm going to keep updating.

banners.txt - These are all of the banners I have seen for the service.

exploit.rb - Proof of concept code. DEPRECATED (was written for version 1.0)

link_injection.rb - The metasploit module I wrote. Figured one off scripts aren't really that used.
